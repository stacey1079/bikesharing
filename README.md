# NYC Bikesharing Challenge

## Overview of the Statistical Analysis
The purpose of this analysis is to prove to investors that a bikesharing program in Des Moines is a solid business proposal.  In order to prove this, I had to create some new bikesharing visualizations to show to the stakeholders.  The first set of visualizations show the length of time that the bikes are checked out for all riders and genders.  The next set of visualizations show the number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour for each day of the week.  The next set of visualizations I created were to show the numer of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week.  The last set of visualizations I used were to show the top starting and ending locations that bikes were checked out.  

## Results
### Checkout Times for Users:

This visualization shows that the highest average checkout time per rider was 5 minutes in duration.
### Checkout Times by Gender:

This visualiation shows that the highest average checkout time for men was 5 minutes, and for women it was 6 min.  The unknown gender data has a highest average between 10-23 minutes.
### Trips By Weekday For Each Hour:

This visualization shows that the highest usage hours on weekdays are between 6am and 9am, and 5 pm and 7 pm which is consistent with the average work week.  This shows many users during the week are most likely biking to/from work.  On weekends, usage seems to be pretty consistently between 10am - 5pm.  
### Trips By Gender (Weekday per Hour):

This visualization shows the majority of users during the highest periods of use are male.
### User Trips by Gender by Weekday:

This heatmap visualization shows that the majority of male users are subscribers.  More women are subscribers, than just customers.  All unknown users are customers, and not subscribers.  This could be because their data has not been stored, since they are not subscribers.

### Top Starting Locations:

This map shows the most active locations for bike checkout are around midtown to lower Manhattan.

### Top Ending Locations:

This map shows that the most active return locations are the same as checkout which are mostly around midtown to lower Manhattan.
## Summary
Based on these visualizations, it seems that bikesharing in Des Moines would work out great!  It would be best to put rental locations in areas where there are high volumes of residential spaces along with working spaces.  Those seem to be the most convenient locations in order to get people to/from work.  Also, marketing to men to become subscribers seems like it would be a great option.  Based on our results for trip duration, rental locations need to mostly be within a 5 minute bike ride radius as the majority of trips were around that duration.  

Another visual that may be helpful for future analysis would be a trip by age/hour/weekday.  This would help to find out the average age of users in order to help market the bikesharing app.  Also, I think a visual showing the average customer/subscriber by age would be helpful as well so that we can see what the average age of most subscribers are.
