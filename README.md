# NYC Bikesharing Challenge

## Overview of the Statistical Analysis
The purpose of this analysis is to prove to investors that a bikesharing program in Des Moines is a solid business proposal.  In order to prove this, I had to create some new bikesharing visualizations to show to the stakeholders.  The first set of visualizations show the length of time that the bikes are checked out for all riders and genders.  The next set of visualizations show the number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour for each day of the week.  The next set of visualizations I created were to show the numer of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week.  The last set of visualizations I used were to show the top starting and ending locations that bikes were checked out.  

## Results

This visualiation shows that the highest average checkout time for men was 5 minutes, and for women it was 6 min.  The unknown gender data has a highest average between 10-23 minutes.

This visualization shows that the highest usage hours on weekdays are between 6am and 9am, and 5 pm and 7 pm which is consistent with the average work week.  This shows many users during the week are most likely biking to/from work.  On weekends, usage seems to be pretty consistently between 10am - 5pm.  
### Trips By Gender (Weekday per Hour):

This visualization shows the majority of users during the highest periods of use are male.

This heatmap visualization shows that the majority of male users are subscribers.  More women are subscribers, than just customers.  All unknown users are customers, and not subscribers.  This could be because their data has not been stored, since they are not subscribers.
